# Tableau Visualisations and Dashboards
These are some of the dashboards I created to practice using Tableau as a visualiation and analysing tool.

## **Dataset 1: Coffee Chain Sales Data**

This exercise is to create visualisations and dashboard and provide analysing document to demonstrate the key insights and recommendations.

1. Key insights on the performance of the coffee chain company based on the visualisations generated using Tableau

2. A functional & dynamic dashboard that enables self-service business users with the capabilities to:

- Explore the profit vs sales of each market, states, and post-codes

- Explore which product invested more in marketing and whether or not that investment positively correspond to the profitability and sales of a particular product

- Conduct 'what if' scenarios to improve overall profitability of the company when decrease or increase the supply amount of particular products

3. Provide recommendation using the dashboard and any other visualisations
